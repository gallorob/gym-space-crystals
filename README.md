# gym-space-crystals
The Space Crystal environment is an [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment for reinforcement learning.

Loosely inspired by the [Crystal Quest](https://www.mobygames.com/game/crystal-quest_) game for MacOS and other platforms.

Future updates for curriculum learning and open-ended learning are planned.
